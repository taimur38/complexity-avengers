# Complexity Avengers


Andres has some weird R packages - 

install colmaps using `devtools::install_github("nebulae-co/colmaps")`

Link to big data that isn't in git -- https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yThW6SzmV8m25NzCUBlxDQJI9V7-w1y8?usp=sharing 

everything in there goes to 'data/big/', which we don't commit to git
